 Hi, I’m Gabriel H. Campos, an enthusiastic and dedicated IT student.

 I’m interested in JavaScript, SQL, and Cloud Computing (especially Azure).

 I’m currently learning JavaScript and its functionalities to build robust front-end and back-end solutions.

 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Systems Analysis (Análise de Sistemas), focusing on data visualization and reporting using Azure and Tableau in conjunction with SQL.
